#Key Terms

##Testing

**Impact Analysis** - The assessment of change to a development documentation to implement a change in requirements

**Static_Analysis** - Analysis of code without the need to run it. Usually done with a supporting tool

**Equivalence Partitioning** - covering each partition at least once

**Boundary Value Analysis** - Test cases are designed based on boundary values

**Inspection** - Peer reviewing code on a visual level to find defects. Most formal Technique, always documented

**Review** - Evaluation of project status to reccomend improvements. Examples include inpection, walkthroughs, technical reviews etc.

**Configuration Management** - Applying technical and administrative direction to identify the physical and technical aspects of a configuration item, also control changes to these aspects, report the implementation of them and verify them with requirements

**Configuration Item** - a collection of hardware, software or both. Treated as a single entity in the configuration management process

**Test Basis** - All documents from which the requirements of a component or system can be inferred. If a document can only be amened formally then it is known as a *frozen test basis*
